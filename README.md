# shell environment

---

### This is a shell environment directory.
I only move files to here, having no idea how to automatically allocate them properly.
Waiting for further improvement.

For now there are vimrc, tcshrc

# Note

If you want to use YouCompleteMe in vim, you need to install it manually.
Go to `.vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe` and run the following command
``` bash
python3 install.py --clang-completer
```
For more detail, please see their repo.
